# Contributing to the resource pack

## General rules
1. Do not override any Minecraft textures unless absolutely necessary.
2. If you have more than 5 custom items, place them in a new custom directory.
3. Custom directories can, and should, be shared between contributors, unless explicit instruction is given not to use any directory.

## Rules regarding models
1. Custom models placed on items with durability should be variated with durability changes before custom model data. If a model is a texture variant, or a slight modification of another existing model, custom model data should be used instead.
2. On items without durability changes, model variants should be avoided. However, if there arises a need for a custom model, extra digits that modify at least the thousands place should be added to the front of the number. (e.g. Model 21-> Model 10021)
